# Organization of the brain

- 3 major areas
  - <u>Hindbrain</u>
    - Evolved earliest
    - Sometimes called "reptilian brain"
    - Controls life support functions
  - <u>Midbrain</u>
    - Controls basic life support functions
  - <u>Forebrain</u>
    - Most recently evolved
      - the largest part
    - What makes us human
    - Primarily made up of the <u>cerebral cortex</u>
      - Divided into two hemisphere
      - <u>Contralateral organization</u>
        - Info received on the left goes to right hemisphere and info received on right goes to the left.
      - Connected by <u>Corpus callosum</u>
        - Band of 200 billion neurons
        - Primary purpose is to communicate between hemispheres
      - Hemispheres are practically identical
      - Important, but not solely responsible for, processing sensory information
        - the first place in the brain that visual information goes.

- General Principles of brain functions
  - Oldest areas control more basic life support
    - More resistant to damage
      - Hindbrain is less likely to be harmed
      - If you're brain-dead, your hindbrain still works
  - More recently evolved parts control higher level functions (consciousness)
  - Neurons close to one another tend to control similar functions


## Specialization of the two hemispheres
- Paul Broca's patients
  - Had problems with speech production
    - Could understand language, but not _produce_ speech.
  - Damage to left hemisphere, near frontal lobe
  - Little to none damage to right hemisphere
- Carl Wernicke's patients
  - Damage pattern same as Broca's, but damanged in the _rear_ temporal lobe
  - Had problems with speech _comprehension_, not production.

## Hemispheric specialization - split brain patients
- Cut the corpus callosum to prevent the spread of epilepsy 
- Effects
  - Left and right seem to want different things
- What do they look like?
  - Someone who's had this operation might take clothes out of their closet wih left and hand their right hand will put it back
- How do we test?
  - Present information ONLY to one side
- Right hemisphere processing music
- Left hemisphere processing language
