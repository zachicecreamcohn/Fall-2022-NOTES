# Neurotransmitters and behavior?

- Even as recent as 1970's, treatment had not progressed
- Prefrontal Lobotomy
  - Believed the major depression disorder came from the prefrontal cortex and the way to treat it was to cut the connection between prefrontal cortex and rest of the brain
- Revolution in treatment
  - Comes from an ability to understand the physiological reasons behind psychopathology
  - Schizophrenia and dopamine
    - Understanding that dopamine overactivity causes schizophrenia helps treatment
    - Serotonin and mood disorders
      - Not just a neurotransmitter, but _where in the brain_ it's released
      - Prozac (SSRI)
        - Blocks the reuptake of the serotonin inhibitors

- Endorphins
  - Natural opiates
    - Important for pain regulation
    - Highest levels of natural endorphins released?
  - Highest levels of natural endorphins are released after childbirth
  - Endorphins and anorexia nervosa
    - Lack of food causes system to release endorphins

## Central nervous system | The brain
- What determines level of brain complexity
  - Ratio of brain weight to body weight
  - Importance of cerebral cortex
  
- Major goal of research on the brain is to find out which areas of the brain are important for different functions
  - Electrical stimulation based on action potential as basis for communication
- There is **never one area responsible for any one behavior**

- Function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
  - Can look at brain activity while someone is doing a given activity
  - Allows for a very good resolution look of different brain areas
  - <u>Functional connectivity</u>
    - Look at areas of the brain that activate together and deactivate together when doing a specific task
- Lesion studies
  - Destroy a part of an animal's brain
  - Study change in behavior
  - Doesn't indicate a specific area controls the changed behavior, but it shows that part of the brain is an element of a _system_ that controls the studied behavior
  - Limitations
    - Animal brains are different from ours
