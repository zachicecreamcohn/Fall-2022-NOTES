## Illusions

- Illusions are some of the clearest examples of difference between sensation and perceptions
- Use assumptions we make to foo

- <u>Figure-ground confusions</u>
  - Ambiguous figures
  - No clear cues to figure vs ground
  - Faces/vase image
  - Old/young lady

## Learning and perception
- Cochlear implants
  - a small wire wrapped in electrodes
  - funneled through cochlea, putting electrodes very close to auditory nerve
  - Sensations are not speech
  - Issues
    - Not everyone is successful with cochlear implants
      - We don't know why
    - Some learning involved in getting them to work
      - Sensations are not speech. We must work to perceive the sensations _as speech_
- Restored sight
  - people born blind
    - learn to identify things by touch
    - Operation to eliminate blindness
    - Will they be able to identify an object by sight (if they've only every perceived it via touch)
    - WIll have to learn the concept of color
- Visual Distortion studies
  - Subjects wear glasses that flip the world 180 degrees (everything's upside down)
  - Early effects
    - Doing anything is very hard
  - After about a week
    - Subjects can do everything normally, adjusted their world based on new sensory input

## Controlling Attention
- Can we always control our attention
- <u>Stroop Effect</u>
  - Delay in reaction time between congruent and non-congruent stimuli
  - Distinction between automatic and controlled processing
    - Automatic
      - Reading
    - Controlled
      - Color naming
  - How do we avoid the stroop effect
    - _If you can be hypnotized to believe the words are foreign words, you'll avoid the Stroop Effect_
- <u>Circadian rhythms</u>
  - 24-hour body clock
  - Many functions exhibit circadian rhythms
  - Affect overall ability to attend to particular stimuli

## Sleep
- Importance of the electroencephalogram (EEG)
  - Can look at electroactivity of groups of brain neurons
  - How does brain activity change when you're sleeping?
- Stages of Sleep
  - Usually 4-5 cycles of sleep per night.
    1. Awake
       1. Low-voltage, high-frequency beta waves
    2. Drowsy
       1. Alpha waves
    3. Stage 1 sleep
       1. Theta sleep
    4. Stage 2 sleep
       1. Sleep spindles and mixed EEG activity 
    5. Slow-wave sleep (stage 3 and 4)
       1. Progressively more delta waves
       - Only 10% will report dreaming if woken
    6. REM sleep
       - Low-voltage, high-frequency waves
       - Brain activity looks very similar to an awake state
          - Muscles are most relaxed
          - Least likely stage to sleepwalk
       - Most difficult stage to wake someone from
       - If awakened from this state about 90% will report dreaming
       - REM sleep is so important that every other stage are called "non-REM sleep"
       - REM rebound
         - If you are prevented from entering REM (woken or prevented from sleeping), the next sleep opportunity, your body will jump directly into REM
- Initial theories about sleep
  - <u>Unitary state theory</u>
    - Everyone sleeps the same
    - _this is wrong_
