# Module 2: Reasearch Strategies: How Psychologists Ask and Answer Questions

## The Need for Psychological Science

### Did We Know It All Along? Hindsight Bias
- <u>Hindsight Bias</u>
  - The tendency to believe, after learning an outcome, that one would have forseen it.
### Overconfidence
- <u>Philip Tetlock</u>
  - Collected more than 27,000 expert predictions of world events. 
  - Found that these predictions, which experts made with 80% confidence (on average), were right < 40% of the time.
- <u>Superforecasters</u>
  - A term coined by Tetlock to describe the 2% of people who do an excellent job rpedicting social behavior. 
  - Avoid overconfidence.
    - a superforecaster "gathers facts, balances clashing arguments, and settles on an answer."

### Perceived Order in Random Events
- In actual random sequences, patterns and streaks occur more often than most expect

## Psychological Science in a Post-Truth World
- <u>Peter Ditto (and his colleagues)</u>
  - Reported in 2019 that researches found "partisan bias in both liberals and conservatives, and at virtually identical levels"
- <u>Repetition</u>
  - When statements are repeated, they are more believable
- <u>Availability of powerful examples</u>
  - powerful examples make people overestimate the prevelenace of a certain risk (or other)
- <u>Echo Chamber</u>
  - We often read news sources that affirm our views, demonize news sources that don't.

## The Scientific Method
### Constructing Theories
- <u>Theory</u>
  - an explanation using an integrated set of principles that organizes observations and predicts behaviors or events.
- <u>Hypothesis</u>
  - a testable prediction, often implied by a theory
- <u>Operation Definition</u>
  - a carefully worded statement of the exact procedures (operations) used in a research study. f
  - (Also known as operationalization.) 
  - _For example, human intelligence may be operationally defined as what an intelligence test measures._
- <u>Preregistration</u>
  - Publicly communicating planned study design, hypotheses, data collection, and analyses.
- <u>Meta-Analysis</u>
  - Statistical procedure for analyzing the results of _multiple_ studies to reach an overall conclusion
### Description
- <u>Case Studies</u>
  - In-depth analyses of individuals or groups
- <u>Naturalistic Observations</u>
  - Recording the natural behavior of many individuals
- <u>Surveys and Interviews</u>
  - Asking people questions

### Correlation
- <u>Correlation Coefficient</u>
  - a statistical index of the relationship between two things 
  - (from âˆ’1.00 to +1.00)

#### Illusory Correlations and Regression Toward the Mean
- <u>Illusory Correlation</u>
  - Perceiving a relationship where none exists _OR_ perceiving a stronger-than-actual relationship
- <u>Regression Toward the Mean</u>
  - The tendency for extreme or unusual scores or events to fall back (regress) toward the average

### Experimentation

### Experimental Manipulation
- <u>Experimental Group</u>
  - In an experiment, the group exposed to the treatment (to one version of the independent variable)
- <u>Control Group</u>
  - The group _not_ exposed to the treatment.
  - contrasts with the experimental group and serves as a comparison for evaluating the effect of the treatment
