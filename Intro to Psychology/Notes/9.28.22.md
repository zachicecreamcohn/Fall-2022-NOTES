# Sensation and Perception

### Key Questions:
- _What's the active stimulus?_
- _What's the relationship between physical stimulus and experience/perception_
- _What's the mapping of how the stimulus is transduced?_


## Color Perception
- Nothing inherent in light that is color
  - Color itself is interpreted by the brain
  - Species differences
  - Everyone sees colors slightly differently
- Question:
  - <u>What processes give rise to the _perception_ of color?</u>

### Theories of color vision
- We don't have a unifying theory of color perception
- We don't know exactly how we perceive color

- <u>Trichromatic Theory</u> (Young-Helmholtz)
  - Found three different kinds of cones (color receptors)
    - Each has a different photochemical
    - Respond differently to different waves of light
      - RGB
      - Red (long wave)
      - Green (medium wave)
      - Blue (short wave)
      - Any color can be made from the combination of these three primary colors (RGB)
  - How do we see color?
    - Display a color (pink, for example)
    - All three cones respond (fire)
      - Cone type most responsive to red fires most
      - Cone types most responsive to green and blue fire less
      - Our **INTERPRETATION** pattern dictates that (and how) we experience the color as pink
- How does color blindness result according to this theory?
  - Complete color-blindness is VERY RARE
    - Red-Green is the most common 
  - Selective color blindness
  - Not a matter of not seeing colors, but about interpreting the colors differently
  - According to trichromatic theory, deficiencies in a cone type dictate color-blindness.
- **Problems for the trichromatic theory**
  - Doesn't account for After images
  - Demo
    1. Turn off lights
    2. Show image of strangely-colored american flag
    3. a dot in the center of the image
    4. Stare at the dot (try not to blink)
    5. The slide is changed to an image of a white screen.
    6. Continue staring at same place on screen
    7. When looking at blank screen, an imprint of the american flag is visible for a while
- <u>The Opponent Process Theory</u>
  - Photochemicals in cones arranged in opposed pairs
    - Red-Green
    - Blue-Yellow
    - Black-White
  - Colors oppose one another
    - Firing of one in a pair actively inhibits the firing of it's pair
  - After images
    - Fatiguing one set of detectors, actively inhibiting the other cones
    - When switch to neutral image (white screen), see the opposing cones
      - One half of each pair is fatigued, so the others fire relatively more
    - When red stimulus prevents seeing green...
      - Cones with photochemical sensitive to the longest wavelength inhibit firing in cones having photochemicals sensitive to medium wavelengths

## Hearing
- Adequate Stimulus: 
  - Air: air pressure
  - Sound: water movement
  - Vibrating object in elastic medium = sound
- How does adequate stimulus get transduced (cause action potential)
  - Inner ear
    - The cochlea - filled with fluid, not air
      - Basilar membrane
        - Hair cells on the basilar membrane that are bending. This is how we detect sound input
        - Tonotopic organization
          - Hair cells that respond to particular frequencies are located in particular areas
            - High frequencies are located at apex
            - Low frequencies are located at the base
- Relationship between physical and perceptual features
  - Frequency -  cycles per second (Hz) = Pitch
  - Amplitude - decibels = Loudness
    - Decibels
      - We can hear from about 0db to 100db (without pain)
      - 0db is not the lowest loudness
