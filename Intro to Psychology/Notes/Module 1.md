# Module 1: What is Psychology?

## Psychology is a Science
- No matter how sensible-seeming or wild an idea is, we must think _Does it work?_
- A Scientific attitude is required
  - skeptical, but not cynical. Open-minded, but not gullible.
  - Humility
    - awareness that we can be wrong
  
## Critical Thinking
- <u>Critical Thinking</u>
  - examine assumptions
  - discern hidden biases
  - evaluate evidence
  - assess conclusions

## Psychological Science is Born
### Psychology's First Laboratory
- December 1879, in Germany
  - <u>Wilhelm Wundt</u>
    - Opened the first psychological laboratory. Referred to as the "start of scientific psychology"
      - Created a machine to measure how long it took for a person to hit a telegraph key after a ball hit a platform
        - When asked to hit key when sound occured, people responded in 1/10th of a second.
        - When asked to hit key when consciously aware of hearing the sound, 2/10th of a second.
      - Saught to measure "atoms of the mind"

### Psychology's First Schools of Thought
- <u>Structuralism</u>
  - Pioneered by <u>Edward Bradford Titchener</u>
  - Aimed to classify and understand the mind's structure
    - Breaking things down into component parts
    - Often uses introspection
  - Break behavior or subjective experience into component parts and see how they fit together
    - _Example: How long does it take to make a decision?_
      - Can't time individual mental processes
      - Start with simple task involving decision
          - <u>Choice reaction time experiment</u>
            - See either `+` or `-` sign on computer screen
            - If you see `+` press the `A` key. If you see `-` press the `L` key
      - Break things into component parts (Complex Reaction/Task)
        - Detect visual info and send to brain
        - Decide if it was `+` or `-`
        - Brain sends signal to press either `A` or `L`
        - _How long did that take?_
      - Similar task (Simple Reaction/Task)
        - Press `A` as soon as you see either a `+` or `-`
        - Component parts
          - Detect visual info and send to brain
          - _no decision needs to be made_
          - Brain sends signal to press `A` key
      - Time both tasks and find difference between complex and simple reaction time to get the decision time.

- <u>Functionalism</u>
  - Pioneered by <u>William James</u>
  - The idea that the functions of the mind came about through adaptation
  - 

### Psychology's First Women
- <u>Mary Whiton Calkins</u>
  - In 1890, 30 years before american women's right to vote
    - William James admitted Calkins into his graduate seminar
      - Every other student (all men) dropped out, so James tutored her alone.
    - Earned a Ph.D from Harvard, but the school refused to give it her. They offered her a doctorate from Radcliffe, but she refused it.
  - In 1905, she became the first female president of the American Psychological Association (APA)

- <u>Margaret Floy Washburn</u>
  - First (official) female psychology Ph.D.
  - In 1921, the second female APA president 
  - Wrote _The Animal Mind_


## Psychological Science Matures

- <u>Behaviorism</u>
  - The idea that psychology should be based on human behavior since it is conditioned.
- <u>Freudian (Psychoanalytic) Psychology</u>
  - emphasized the ways the unconscoius mind and childhood/past experiences affect our behavior.
- <u>Humanistic Psychology</u>
  - Led by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow
    - Found behaviorism and freudian psychology limiting
    - focused on our **growth potential, needs for love and acceptance, and environments that nurture or limit personal growth**

## Contemporary Psychology
- <u>Cognitive Revolution</u>
  - 1960s
  - The marriage of cognitive psychology (science of mind) and neuroscience (science of brain) gave birth to <u>Cognitive Neuroscience</u>
    - Studies brain activities underlying mental activity
- <u>Psychology</u>
  - Science of behavior and mental processes

### Evolutionary Psychology and Behavior Genetics
- <u>Plato</u>
  - Assumed that we inherit character and intelligence, that certain ideas are inborn
- <u>Aristotle</u>
  - Believed there is nothing in the mind that does not first come from external world, via senses
- <u>John Locke</u>
  - Argued mind is a blank slate on which experience writes
- <u>Ren√© Descartes</u>
  - Believed _some_ ideas are innate

### Cross-Cultural and Gender Psychology
- <u>WEIRD cultures</u>
  - Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic

### Positive Psychology
- <u>Martin Seligman (and others)</u>
  - Called for research on <u>Human Flourishing</u>
    - Understanding nd developing emotions and trains that help us survive
      - Called their appraoch <u>Positive Psychology</u>
        - The idea that happiness is a by-product of a pleasent, engaged, and meaningful life
