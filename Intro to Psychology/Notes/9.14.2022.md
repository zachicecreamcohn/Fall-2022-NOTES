# Biological basis of behavior

## Thoughts controlling behavior
- State of the art in understanding brain-behavior relationships
- Individual unable to move arm or other parts of body due to spinal cord injury
  - Use thoughts of moving the arm to control a computer
  - Computer is trained to decode specific patterns of neural firing into specific movements
  - Demonstrates a specific pattern of neural firing for each body movement

## Thoughts controlling computer
- A sheet of electrodes on the brain itself (open their head)
  - Can stimulate parts of the brain 

## Biological basis of heavior
- Developed from Structuralist framework
- Our goal
  - How can knowing about the nervous system help us understand behavior?
- Rate of new information
  - SUPER FAST
- The nervous system
  - To understand how we can interpret brain activity, we must understand the fundamentals of the nervous system
  - Communication
    - about both the external world and internal world
  - <u>Neuron</u>
    - The basic unit of the nervous system
    - Humans have about 1 trillion neurons
    - Each neuron is connected (on average) to 15,000 other neurons
    - Made up of
      - Cell body
      - Axon
        - tubular structures
        - range in size from 10th of a micron to 4 feet.
        - connects one neuron to another
      - Some neurons have Myelin sheath
        - Wraps around the axon
        - not continuous
          - Broken at points called Nodes of Ranvier
        - Similar to insulation around copper wire
        - Allows very fast conduction down the axon
          - Reflex
      - Dendrites
      - Terminal buttons
      - Synapse
        - Pre-synaptic neuron
          - Action potential reaches the terminal buttons
            - Inside terminal buttons are synaptic vesicle.
              - Contain neurotransmitters
        - Receptors on post-synaptic neuron
          - Bind neurotransmitters
          - The binding causes action-potential in post-synaptic neuron
            - process is repeated. _Communication!_
    - Majority of neurons don't touch one another 


## The communication solution (how do neurons communicate)
- Electro-chemical communication in the nervous system
  - Electrical
    - <u>The action potential</u>
      - Once neuron is stimulated, an action potential is generated by ions goin in and out of ion gates
      - Set up electrical charge in neuron
        - Starts at axon hillock
        - spreads down axon toward terminal buttons
    - An electrical current that runs along the axon
  - Chemical component (neurotransmitters)

## Characteristics of axon potential
- Action potential is electric charge
- propagates down the axon
- Action potential is binary
  - Can either fire or not fire
- How do we tell the difference between slight touch and a slap
  - Number of neurons firing
  - Frequency of firing
