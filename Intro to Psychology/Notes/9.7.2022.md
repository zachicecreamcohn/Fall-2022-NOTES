## Applying different approaches to multiple personality
### Approach of physiological psychologist
- Looking at basic unit (Neural-firing) to find the problem
  - Use physiological methods to understand (and treat) the behavior

### Approach of behavioral psychologist
- Only care about the patient's behavior
  - Treat the behavior (switching personalities)
    - Reward for not switching, punishment for switching

### Approach of Cognitive Psychologist
- Focus on the thought patterns
  - What is it that precedes a personality shift?
  - What caused the Multiple Personality Disorder
  - Focusing on the mental, the subjective experience of the patient


## Scientific Method and Psychology
- Psychology is the study of mind and behavior
  - Aren't we al experts in this area?
  - We can just use intuition, _right?_ (ehhhh...Not always a good idea)

### Data gathering is crucial
- Main goal of research studies is to test hypotheses

#### Descriptive Data/Research
- Ways og gathering descriptive data
  - <u>Naturalistic Observations</u>
    - Simply go out and observe.
    - Experiment subjects don't know they're being observed
    - Advantages
      - Want to understand behavior as it occurs in the natual world/real-life
    - Disadvantages
      - <u>Observer reactivity</u>
        - The presence of an observer can change the behavior
        - _Goal: minimize Observer reactivity_
  - <u>Case Studies</u>
    - Often used in Neuropsychology
    - A study of a small number of people (sometimes just 1 person)
    - Advantages
      - _example_:
        - HM and short term memory
          - Had a kind of epilipsy.
            - As a treatment, removed his hipocampus.
