# Ethics

## Early (dark) days of research ethics


- Milgrim Experiment
  - Research on obedience to authority by Stanley Milgram
    - _Why did typical German citizens follow Nazi orders?_
  - Process
    - Confederate who is the "learner" (works for the lab)
    - Actual participant is the "teacher"
    - Placed in separate rooms
    - Learner (supposedly) has a shock generator in front of them
    - Learner reads words and "teacher" has to answer
    - If learner gets it wrong (they do it on purpose) teacher is told to give increasing amounts of shock
  - Question
    - How many people would go all the way and give, what they thought, was lethal shock just because Milgram told them to

### General ethical guidelines
- <u>"Do no harm"</u>
  - What's the relative potential benefits vs the potential risks
- <u>Principle of Informed Consent</u>
  - Deception
    - False feedback
- <u>Participation is Voluntary</u>
  - No coercion (can't coerce someone into being in the study)
  - Coercion can be subtle (still bad)
    - Paying someone _a lot_ of money
      - Aka. does the compensation influence the participation? 
  - You must be free to withdraw whenever
  - Competition is NOT contingent on completion
- <u>Importance of debriefing</u>
  - If deception was used in the study, the participant can be offered to exclude their data from the study.
    - In other words, retroactive informed consent
